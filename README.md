## Security

Security is certainly a major requirement for any application. In Finance chat bot, there is a authentication mechanism using passport library which encrypts and validates user's credentials store in the mongo DB in the form of Salt and Hash. First, User is prompted to input the username and password, then it authenticates the user and redirect user to the chat bot screen.

## Error Message

In case of missing credentials or wrong credentials, user will be redirected to the error page.
